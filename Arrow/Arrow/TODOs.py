Directions:
- Architecture agnostic TG, simple, lite and fast
- Open source, monetize via ? support | advance features like Cloud,MemMgr,MultiCore | ???
    - open all or just peripheral?
- Quick and simple usage via StreamLit API
- Allow users to extend content, utils,
- Map all to Asm/DataUnits, to simplify assembly creation, and later rebuild it
- Cpp integration
- Cloud upload, Authentication?

learning:

ARM learning 
- We can use CPULATOR to run and test ARM and RISCV architecture, and run it step by step 
- in arm, CSPR is the equivalent of eflags, yet not all instructions uses it.  
    for example, if we want ADD instruction to use it, need to write ADDS. 
    TODO:: see how to integrate it as part of generate 
- in arm, only selective few instruction touches memory (like LDR, STR), unlike x86, 
    we can use "ldr r1, =label" to set r1 with the address of the memory label (similar to LINADDR), and later we can "ldr r0, [r1]" which will get the stored value from memory 
    TODO:: see how to take this into calculation, as also the registers are very limited, so maybe heavily rely on stack?  

RISCV learning 
- use RARS jave tool, simply run 'java -jar rars1_6.jar' to open the tool (under C:\\RARS_riscv_assembler directory) 
- in the tool "help" there is a list of all RISVC ISA TODO:: need to convert it into db
- start assembling and clean issues    
# Done:: convert RARS ISA into a json that fit the DB
# Done:: pass assembly and simulation
