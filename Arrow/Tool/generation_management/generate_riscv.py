    RISC-V learning:
    - In the ISA-DB, we joined the two memory operands offset(base_reg) as a single "offset_plus_basereg" operand
        Instruction Format Consistency:
        In RISC-V, all load and store instructions that access memory follow the same format: offset(base_reg).
        There’s no concept of accessing memory without specifying both an offset and a base register.
        No Complex Addressing Modes:
        Unlike some other architectures, RISC-V does not have complex memory addressing modes, such as indexed or scaled addressing (like base + index * scale + offset found in x86).
        RISC-V memory addressing is intentionally kept simple to improve instruction decoding and reduce hardware complexity.
    - In Most of the memory usages, the Tool will plant a dynamic_init instruction to place that memory address in a temp register
        this is done to avoid using memories offset due to their formatting requirements and my lack of knowledge.
    - In RISC-V register, the registers are always accessed as full-width entities (e.g., x1 is always treated as a full 32-bit or 64-bit register).
        Instructions like ADD and ADDW determine how much of the register's data to operate on, but they always store the result in the full register.
        There are no sub-registers or overlapping regions like RAX/EAX/AX/AL in x86.
